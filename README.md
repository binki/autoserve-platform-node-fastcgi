Enable deployment of
[`autoserve`](https://github.com/binki/autoserve)-using applications
on FastCGI hosts.

This module is used by `autoserve` by default, so no configuration is
necessary. However, the hosting environment may need
configuration. Please see [`node-fastcgi`’s
docs](https://github.com/fbbdev/node-fastcgi) and your `httpd`
vendor’s FastCGI documentation.
